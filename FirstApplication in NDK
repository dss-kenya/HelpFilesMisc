After installing ndk and assinging the appropriate path,

In the cpp file generated, type the following:

#include <jni.h> // to access all the jni datatypes and methods
#include <android/log.h> // to be able to log from the jni lib

#define APP_NAME "FirstAndroidNDKApp"

JNIEXPORT jint Java_com_azilen_firstandroidndkproject_MainActivity_addTwoNumbers(jint x, jint y) {
		__android_log_print(ANDROID_LOG_INFO,APP_NAME, "value of x : %d \n value of y : %d ",x,y);
		return (x+y);
}

JNIEXPORT and JNICALL are values that are needed as a convention and for proper calling of JNI methods.

Since this method is present in the cpp file, while trying to call the method from the activity in android, 
it would throw java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: methodName

thus, enclose or wrap the cpp method inside 

extern "c" {

} block. this tells jni that the method is part of c itself.

In the android project add the following:
public class MainActivity extends Activity {
  // this loads the library
	static {
		System.loadLibrary("FirstAndroidNDKProject");
	}
	
	// this is the native method
	public native int addTwoNumbers(int x,int y);
	
	@Override
	protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
		super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
		setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
		
		int x= addTwoNumbers(10,20);
		Log.e("dhara"," value of x : " + x);
	}
}

Build the project and run the application.

LEARNINGS:

1. simply writing a function name as addTwoNumbers might not call the function name, hence the naming convention
Java_com_package_name_activity_name_methodName. Also there should be no _ between the method name.
2. Since a cpp method causes exceptions, wrap the code inside extern "c" block
3. if the library name is "libProjectName".so, always call the library as System.loadLibrary("ProjectName"), 
(do not add lib)
